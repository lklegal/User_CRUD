# User CRUD

This is a very simple practice project for the "Vem Ser Tech - Backend" bootcamp, from Ada Tech. Here I put in practice what I have learned from how to make RESTful APIs.

Here a fictional user can create an account, login to their account, see all usernames in the database without having to login (I'm sure that's fine), see all their own data (hashed passwors, salts and all), change their password and delete their account.

Authentication is done using JWT. Password security is basic hash and salt.
